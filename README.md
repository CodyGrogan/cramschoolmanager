This project has two package.json files, one in the main directory, and one in the client.
Two build the project you need to install dependencies in both folders.

This project was created as an exerice in developing my own CRUD app with a React Frontend and a Node.js backend using MongdoDB. User authentication is handled with FirebaseAuth, and the website also supports a default "demo" account to allow users to try the app without actually providing their email.
